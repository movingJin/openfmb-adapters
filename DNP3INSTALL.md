# DNP3 Installation

The DNP3 L2 adapter provided installs the master and slave components on your system.  The package install configuration files for the adapter.

The following figure depicts the logical setup of the DNP3 adapter.  In this configuration the adapter configuration file contains the configuration for each device in the microgrid. The purpose of this was to support integration testing of the adapter with the MQTT broker and HMI.  The configuration file can be manipulated to create a single device interface for the DNP3 test set or an actual device.
